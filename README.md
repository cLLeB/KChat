# KChat: Private Chat. No Strings Attached.

**KChat** is a minimalist, privacy-first chat application designed for secure, end-to-end encrypted communication. No accounts, no history, no logs. Just pure privacy.

Create a secure, anonymous chat room in seconds. Share a link, pick a nickname, and start a conversation that disappears when you're done. All messages are end-to-end encrypted, so only you and the person you're talking to can read them.

- **Topics:** chat, css, end-to-end-encryption, express, html, javascript, npm, open-source, react, render, replit, typescript

## ‚ú® Features

KChat is packed with features that put your privacy first:

-   **Stay Anonymous:** No accounts, no sign-up, no data collection. Your identity is yours to keep.
-   **Conversations Vanish:** Messages and images self-destruct after a set time. No digital footprint.
-   **Share Moments, Not Memories:** Images disappear after they're viewed once.
-   **Crystal-Clear & Secure Audio Calls:** Encrypted, peer-to-peer voice calls for when text isn't enough.
-   **Serverless & Secure:** We store zero data. Everything is encrypted and transmitted directly between you and your chat partner.
-   **Locked & Private:** We actively shield you from screen recording and spyware, keeping your conversations truly private.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

KChat uses a lightweight architecture to keep things simple and private.

-   **Client:** A web-based interface built with React and TypeScript that handles the user interface, end-to-end encryption, and all privacy features.
-   **Server:** A small Express-based server that coordinates handshake messages and session creation without ever seeing your messages.
-   **Encryption:** We use the Web Crypto API for strong, end-to-end encryption.
